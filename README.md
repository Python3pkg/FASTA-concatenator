FASTA Concatenator
==================

# Installation

The easiest way is with `pip`:

`pip install fastacat`

After this, simply use the command `fastacat`.

# Usage

`fastacat PATH`

`PATH` is the name of the tabular file (TSV file) which needs to be
concatenated. `fastacat` will put the resulting TSV file, as well as a
FASTA-formatted file, in a directory called `output/`. The TSV and
FASTA files will be named `output.tsv` and `output.fasta`,
respectively.
